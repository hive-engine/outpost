# Outpost

Blogging platform built on top of Hive and Hive-Engine, connected to a customizable reward pool to link people with a common interest. Outposts also include an NFT marketplace, own DTF, and Diesel Pool.

## Getting Ready

- Create a Hive-Engine token (https://tribaldex.com/tokens/create)
- You may enable Staking, Delegation token (https://tribaldex.com/tokens/manage)
- Create a reward pool for your token (https://tribaldex.com/smt/manage)
- Fill out the form to set up Outpost on your domain (https://tribaldex.com/smt/outpost)

If you already have SCOT Bot setup for your token and want to migrate, just fill out the form here https://tribaldex.com/smt/outpost.

## Configuration

All the configurable values are in the `config.js` file. Feel free to change them as needed.

We are using SCSS for styling. You can find them in the `assets/scss` folder.

To change the default link preview image (`cover.png`), favicon (`favicon.ico`), and logo (`logo.png`), replaces the files in the `static` folder.
