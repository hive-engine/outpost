## **Philosophy**


Lasse Ehlers identify as an anarchocapitalist and flat earther, he learned about the philosophy of anarchocapitalism from Stefan Molyneux' videos in 2010, but it was first in April 2013, when he saw Bitcoin, that he believe anarchocapitalism was possible in practicallity. Eventhough Stefan Molyneux is ignorant to the truth about that the earth is flat, Lasse Ehlers acknowledge him as one of the biggest philosophers of our time, if not the biggest, esspecially for his work with spreading awareness of the philosophy of anarchocapitalism.

Lasse Ehlers believes that we need to use our real identity in order to create a free society, this idea originates from Stefan Molyneux and he might be the one who came up with the idea and/or formulated it the first time. Lasse Ehlers therefore advocating using your real name on the internet, if everyone did it and used cryptocurrencies all the time, then Illuminati's statism systems (based on satanism) would very fast come to an end. Lasse Ehlers believe anarchocapitalism will happen, that it is inevitably after the creation of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.

Lasse Ehlers acknowledge Murray Rothbard as the philosopher who first formulated the philosophy of anarchocapitalism. Lasse Ehlers also gives credit to Jeff Berwick for spreading the word about anarchocapitalism over the internet for many years. 

Lasse Ehlers believed since he saw Bitcoin and read the white paper in April 2013, that blockchain technology has the potential (that it is almost imminent and sure that it will happen) to end the Illuminati system/satanism/banking system/statism which he knew since 2004 destroy a lot of peoples lifes. **LasseCash and related products is Lasse Ehlers' implementations, to end these horrors on the flat earth.**

Lasse Ehlers learned first about the ideas about that the earth could be flat in 2016, by 2017 he was convinced. Back then there was many relevant videos on the internet on the topic, but most of those videos has been censored. Here are two flat earth proofs formulated by Lasse Ehlers:

## **Inventions**



Apart from coming up with the ideas for LasseCash and 5 other related tokens, Lasse Ehlers invented 5 new terms:

### Fiat monster / fiat trash / fiat slave


*Definition*


*Fiat monster* is a term to mark somebody as heavily involved in the fiat money system or that he or she got his or her fortune from fiat money, but moved them later into cryptocurrency, precious metals or similar real money.

The term is used to devalue a persons moral standards and ethical value.

### Real life hero


*Definition*


A man is a *real life hero* when he opposes the current fiat money system, build by the Illuminati. He will only work (or for the most part, only in emergency will he work for fiat money) for real money, like crypto currencies and precious metals.

He probably is broke a lot of his life, since the fiat money system almost have monopoly on work and money. Since crypto currencies he has better opportunity to make money from free market work (maybe even a fortune) and earn what he rightfully deserve.

### Fiat chick


*Definition*


A *fiat chick* is a woman that focuses on a mans income in fiat money when choosing a partner. I believe that it is mostly woman that choose men in the love market. So woman holds a lot of power, especially in the current satanic system, where courts 99% favors woman in divorces etc. A woman that divorce a man and father to their child, because of she think she can find another man with higher fiat income and get child support etc is also (probably more extreme form of) a *fiat chick*.

The term is invented to mark woman with this behavior as a person with low moral standards and a low ethical value as a person.

### Crypto woman / free market woman


*Definition*


A woman that live by the non aggression principal defined in the philosophy anarcho capitalism, is a *crypto woman* or *free market woman*. She refuse to involve herself in fiat money as much as possible and choose only to mate with a man that is a real life hero.

She would never use the corrupt court system to kidnap her mans child and she despite all men and woman that are heavily involved in the fiat money system.

### Hero child


*Definition*


A *hero child*, is one that is raised by both real parents, who are a *crypto woman* and a *real life hero*.

The hero child don't go to any government school, knows about illuminati, free masonery, flat earth and related topics. The *hero child* get to do what ever they want and begin to produce products at an early age.

A hero child is raised by like-minded people, both adults and children and of course of today, is extremely rare.
