Yes, you need a Hive account, there are several ways to [create a Hive account](https://signup.hive.io).

## <span id="What_is_lassecash">Why is my post not showing up at Google?</span>
The old condensor site worked very well at indexing posts on Google, unfortunately that is still being worked on, on the new OUTPOST site www.lassecash.com , we believe it will work again at one point in the future.

## <span id="What_is_lassecash">What is the easiest way to buy LASSECASH?</span>
The DEX hive-engine.com provide the ability to deposit older cryptocurrencies like forinstance Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin (among others), after depositing then you can swap those for SWAP.HIVE which you can buy LASSECASH for. That is the easiest route to buy LASSECASH. It also works the other way of-course, so you can also sell LASSECASH for older cryptocurrencies on the same site. LASSECASH are exchanged on many Hive-engine based DEXs and in the SWAP.HIVE:LASSECASH diesel pool.
